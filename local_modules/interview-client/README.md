# Quick Chat Client

### Summary
This project contains an SDK for a brand-new Twilio service: QuickChat. QuickChat is a simple WebSocket implementation that relays messages between connected clients, storing up to the 10 most recent messages for each conversation.

### Your Task
Your task is to use the SDK module (in `lib/index.js`) in an application that uses all of its available features (see the test file for more information around how the API is expected to behave)

#### Running Mocha (Test Runner)
```
npm install
gulp test
```
